***Logic Diagram Coming Soon***

## Known Bugs

- Depending on browser, operating system, and CPU, behavior of the automated demo may be different. This is, at the moment, uncontrollable.

## Future Updates

- Optimization of z axis correction *(currently inefficient because gravity consistently pulls it down)*
- Auto Mode On/Off Switch
- Telemetry Visual Graphs
- Randomize starting points *(original code has the initial offsets as a constant)*
